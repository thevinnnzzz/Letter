                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I can’t believe it's already been two months since we’ve been together. Time has flown by so quickly, and I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. Every single day with you feels like a blessing, and I can’t imagine my life without you in it.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I know I’ve been busy and sometimes forgetful, and I want to say I'm really sorry for that. Please know that it’s never because I don’t care—it’s just that life gets in the way sometimes. But even on those days when I’m distracted, you’re always on my mind. I’m trying to be better, to give you more of my time, attention, and love. You deserve that, and I’m committed to being the person you deserve.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; Your smile, your laughter, the way you make everything brighter—those are the moments I hold onto, and they remind me just how lucky I am to have you. I’ve never felt so much warmth and happiness before, and I can’t thank you enough for that.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; So, here I am, saying it out loud… I like you more than I can express. Maybe even love you. Every day, my feelings for you just keep growing, and I’m so excited for all the moments ahead. You make me want to be a better person, and for that, I’ll always be grateful.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; Here’s to us—two months down, forever to go. Thank you for being patient with me, for loving me, and for just being you. I promise to keep cherishing you, making you smile, and reminding you of how truly special you are to me.
                    </span>
                </p>
